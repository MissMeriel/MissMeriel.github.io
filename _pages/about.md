Bio
===

I am a computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia, advised by [Sebastian Elbaum](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/sebastian-elbaum), and a member of [LESS lab](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/). 
I have a BA in Islamic art and architecture from Oberlin College, an MS in Computer Science from the University of Virginia, and 5 years of industry experience at NASA Kennedy and NASA Goddard. 
My Masters' work was on assessing the conditional invariants and probabilistic distributions implicit in single and swarm drone systems. 
My current research interests are in *analysis, testing, and verification of machine learning systems*, especially in the context of cyber-physical systems.

Research Interests
===
My research interests are in bridging the gap between software and physical environment in robotics and autonomous cyberphysical systems. 
In particular, I am interested in how we can adapt software engineering methodologies for quality assurance, 
such as software analysis, testing, and probabilistic prediction, to systems that rely on actuation and the sensed environment to complete their tasks.
