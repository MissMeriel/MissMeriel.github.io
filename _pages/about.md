Bio
===

I am a computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia, advised by [Sebastian Elbaum](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/sebastian-elbaum), and a member of [LESS lab](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/). 
I have a BA in Islamic art and architecture from Oberlin College, an MS in Computer Science from the University of Virginia, and 5 years of industry experience at NASA Kennedy and NASA Goddard. 
My Masters work was on assessing the conditional invariants and probabilistic distributions implicit in single and swarm drone systems. 
My current research interests are in *analysis, testing, and verification of machine learning systems*, especially in the context of cyber-physical systems.

Research Interests
===
My research interests are in ensuring correctness of machine learning systems. In particular, I am interested in how we can adapt software engineering methodologies for quality assurance, such as program analysis, testing, and verification, to systems that use machine learning components.
