abstract: "Most undergraduates are not equipped to manage the unique challenges in developing software for modern robots, despite rapid expansion of the field. We here introduce a course we have designed and delivered to better prepare students to develop software for robot systems. It emphasizes the distinctive challenges of software development for robots paired with related software engineering techniques, it provides many opportunities for experiential learning across both disciplines, and it lowers the barriers for learning how to build robotic systems.
