title: "NaturalADV: An Exploratory Framework to Balance Adversarial Strength and Stealth in Autonomous Driving Environments"
pages: 1
year: 2025
abstract: "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become integral to various real-world autonomous mobile systems, from self-driving cars to food delivery robots. However, current adversarial attack techniques often focus on maximizing the attack strength at the cost of naturalness, leading to examples that are easily detected by humans or deviate significantly from the expected input distribution. This trade-off between adversarial effectiveness and natural appearance presents a critical challenge in ensuring the robustness and reliability of DNNs in practical settings. This work presents the Natural Adversarial DNN Validation (NaturalADV) framework for balancing the trade-off between adversarial strength and naturalness of the adversarial patch's appearance. NaturalADV can incorporate a number of differentiable naturalness metrics, works with various gradient traversal algorithms, and scales to attacks represented in multiple sensor readings. "
