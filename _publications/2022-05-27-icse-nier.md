abstract: "Adversarial testing tends to focus on DNNs in isolation, to the exclusion of the full system state and system behaviors resulting from sequences of DNN output. We propose a more holistic approach to DNN testing that accounts for the effects of perturbations on the system state. Our insight is that, when an adversarial perturbation is situated in the environment and encountered by the system, the way it is sensed and processed by the system depends on system state. Our approach involves three key elements: 1) integration of simulator into the testing process to update state, 2) optimization of perturbation over time, and 3) fitting perturbations to sequences of inputs consistent over spatio-temporally ordered states. These ideas lay a foundation for the testing of systems with DNNs that rely on spatio-temporally related inputs. We illustrate the potential of our idea through adversarial perturbation of the physical environment of an autonomous vehicle."
