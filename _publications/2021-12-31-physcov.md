abstract: "Adequately covering the behaviors of autonomous vehicles ($AV$) is fundamental in their validation. However, quantifying such coverage is challenging as the $AV$s’ behavior is influenced by its physical environment that is often large and highly complex. This work builds on the insights that data sensed by the $AV$ provides a unique spatial signature of the environment inputs and that inputs which reside outside the $AV$’s physically reachable regions are less relevant. Building on those insights, we introduce a new abstraction, RSR, and corresponding coverage metric, PhysCov. RSR integrates the sensor readings with a physical reachability analysis based on the vehicle’s state and dynamics to determine the input region that may affect the $AV$. It then characterizes that region through a parameterizable geometric approximation that can trade quality for cost. Environments with distinct approximations likely result in distinct behavior and thus will increase PhysCov. This paper also provides a study on two $AV$’s running on two different simulators that shows the applicability of RSR to generate PhysCov. The study also demonstrates PhysCov’s ability to quantify an $AV$’s test suite coverage, showcases its characterization cost and precision, and highlights its value in terms of its high-positive correlation with the number of vehicle crashes found."
